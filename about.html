        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to the Water Quiz, a platform built with a passion for sustainability. Our goal is to inspire 
            and empower individuals to make eco-friendly choices and build a sustainable future, one step at a time.
        </p>
        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <p>
            Think of the Water Quiz as "Strava for sustainability." Just like fitness enthusiasts share their 
            progress on Strava, our platform encourages users to share their tips, hacks, and stories about 
            living sustainably. 
        </p>
        <p>
            From conserving water to reducing waste, we provide a fun, interactive way to learn about sustainability, 
            track your efforts, and engage with a like-minded community.
        </p>
        <h2>Why Join Us?</h2>
